# Note-Taker

- Here I have an Express/NodeJs application that allows you to write save and delete notes. On the back end of the application it has api routes set up so you can perform get, post, and delete api requests.

- Before you can run this application you will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.

## Installation

- Clone this repository, run `npm install` and when thats done installing the 'node_modules' run `npm start`

## Usage

- (IF RUNNING LOCALLY) after you've installed it and run the `npm start` in the terminal. You can 'CMD + click' on the http location given to you in the console.

- If you want to run it through on the good ole' internet here's the [link](https://jgs-note-taker.herokuapp.com/)

- Whatever route you chose to run it, its pretty simple from there. Just input a title for your note and then whatever you desire to put into the note. A save button will appear after both criteria have been met and from there you can save it. Your saved notes will appear on the left column and if you click it, it will be displayed so you can view the contents of the note on the right column.

- Feel free to add whatever notes you'd like!
